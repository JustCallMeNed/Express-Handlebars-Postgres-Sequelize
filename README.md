# Express-Handlebars-Postgres-Sequelize
Distributed Codebase project based on Traversy's "build a node.js app with Sequelize" video but using postgres instead of mongoose

Assignment is to build out the CRUD functions in api-routes and gig.controller and get the search functionality working - POST is already built out and functional, but I'm struggling with GET functionality.
PUT, and DELETE I think will fall into place if I can just get unstuck from this one part.
